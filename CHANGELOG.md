## **2.0.7** released on 23rd November 2017

- **Fix:** Word separation rules updated with apostrophe - adding `word` to dictionary doesn't make Spell Right recognize `word's` ([#90](https://github.com/bartosz-antosik/vscode-spellright/issues/90)).

## **2.0.6** released on 17th November 2017

- **New:** New setting `spellright.latexSpellParameters` to point LaTeX commands (e.g. `\title`, `\author`, `\date`, `\section` etc.) that should have parameters spelled. Created extending the request from issue ([#84](https://github.com/bartosz-antosik/vscode-spellright/issues/84)).

## **2.0.0** released on 2nd November 2017

- **New:** Multi Root Workspace ready with all the settings and custom workspace dictionaries having "resource" scope (that is per component root folder). It allows to e.g. have root folders with various languages, document types or custom dictionaries considered for spelling. Users of single root workspaces should not feel any difference to the way it was working so far with the exception of the point below.
- **New:** All the workspace settings are now stored in workspace settings file (`settings.json`) managed by VSCode. It is more in line with recommendations and seems bit more future proof. Current settings can be manually transferred from currently used dedicated workspace settings files (`spellright.json`) remembering that each setting has to be preceded by `spellright.` prefix.
- **New:** Selecting dictionary (language) or switching document class ON/OFF is now persistent and automatically stored in workspace settings if workspace is open or user settings if not.
